  ## üìú About Project
>42 School Philosophers project designed around Edsger Dijkstra's famous [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem). \
> For this project, we must learn about concurrent programming and shared memory synconization.


For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](README_files/philo_subject.pdf).

	üöÄ TLDR: This project is an introduction to the basics of multithreading and multiprocessing.
    	 Work on the same memory space, learn about mutexes, semaphores, and shared memory.
> [üö® ‚Äã!NOTE] \
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating.

## üî∑ Mandatory Part

#### The subject describes the problem as follows:

* One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
* There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
* The spaghetti can only be eaten with two forks.
* There are only as many forks as there are philosophers.
* Each philosopher successively eats, sleeps and thinks.
* If a philosopher hasn't eaten in a certain timeframe, he will die of starvation.
* Philosophers cannot communicate with each other.


#### The program takes the following arguments:

`./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep>
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`

* **```number_of_philosophers```**: the number of philosophers around the table.
* **```time_to_die```**: a number representing the time in milliseconds a philosopher has to live after a meal. If a philosopher hasn‚Äôt started eating time_to_die milliseconds after the beginning of his last meal or the beginning of the simulation, he will die.
* **```time_to_eat```**: a number representing the time in milliseconds a philosopher takes to finish his meal. During that time, the philosopher keeps his two forks in hand.
* **```time_to_sleep```**: the time in milliseconds that a philosopher spends sleeping.
* **```number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat```**: an optional argument that allows the program to stop if all the philosophers have eaten at least that many times. If this argument is not specified, the simulation carries on unless a philosopher dies.



#### Program logs philosophers actions in this format. X is philosopher ID:

```
timestamp_in_ms     X  has taken a fork :
        0           1  is thinking
        0           2  is thinking
        0           2  has taken a fork
        0           2  is eating
        60          2  is sleeping
        60          1  has taken a fork
        60          1  is eating
```

## üåü Bonus Part

For the bonus part of this project, the problem is the same with a few differences: philosophers are now processes, \
and the forks are now counting semaphores. The forks are arranged at the center of the table when not in use, and \
any philosopher can take any fork.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage
### Requirements

The program is written in C language and thus needs the **gcc compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the program**

To compile the mandatoy part, run:

```shell
$ cd Philosophers/philo && make
```

To compile the bonus part, run:

```shell
$ cd Philosophers/philo_bonus && make
```

**2. How to run the program**

Run the program with the following arguments:
```shell
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philo_must_eat]
```

The arguments must be integers between 0 and INT_MAX representing a time in milliseconds. For example:

```shell
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```

If the arguments are valid, the program will output the actions of each philosopher until one of them dies or until all of them have eaten `number_of_times_each_philo_must_eat`, if specified. \
Bonus part takes the same arguments, but needs to run executalbe `philo_bonus` instead of `philo`.
